Metacrafters Project
Programmer: Jan Anonuevo

This program aims to have the ability to mint and burn tokens. The user can check whether tokens are minted/burned by running the TotalSupply function. It also has a conditional that checks whether the tokens intended to be burned is less than the amount of tokens in the supply. If the conditional satisfied is otherwise, it would ignore the burn function call.
